Hello there, I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist and optained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering. I hold further degrees in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics. I have been doing data science and machine learning stuff for more than 7 years now, starting before it was cool :)

I've published over 20 articles in the fields of digital health, health informatics and artificial intelligence.
Here on my GitHub you can find some projects related to my research but also some unrelated personal stuff. 
If our industry partners allow, I will try to release more of my research related projects here.

In terms of programming I'm very proficient with Python and its whole data ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch). In addition, I've been using R for years, although mostly for specialised statistical models, such as generalized mixed effects models or the likes.

In terms of software engineering I'm mainly proficient with Java, having worked with Spring Boot, Hibernate and Android SDK, amongst others.
Further I do have some familiarity with C#, C, Javascript/HTML/CSS, Swift and multiple databases (MySQL, OmniSci, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). 

Most importantly, I like cats (yes yes, dogs can be cute too)!
