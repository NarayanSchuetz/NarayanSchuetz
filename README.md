Hello there, I'm currently a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering. I've degrees in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics and have been doing data science and machine learning stuff before it was cool :)

Over the last five years I've published over 20 articles in the fields of digital health, health informatics and artificial intelligence.
Here on my GitHub you can find some projects related to my research but also some unrelated personal stuff. 
If our industry partners allow, I will try to release more of my research related projects here.

In terms of programming I'm very proficient with Python and its whole data ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch) in addition, I've been using R for years, although only really for specialised statistical models, such generalized mixed linear effects models or the likes.

In terms of software engineering I'm mainly proficient with Java, having worked with Spring Boot, Hibernate and Android SDK, amongst others.
Further I do have some familiarity with C#, C, Javascript/HTML/CSS, Swift and multiple databases (MySQL, OmniSci, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
